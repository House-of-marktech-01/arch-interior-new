        <p className="mt-2">Sustainability is at the forefront of modern architecture. Architects are designing eco-friendly buildings that minimize environmental impact by incorporating green roofs, solar panels, and energy-efficient materials. These designs not only reduce carbon footprints but also promote healthier living environments, aligning with the global push for a sustainable future.</p>

        <p className="mt-2">Architects work hand-in-hand with urban planners to design cities that are functional, inclusive, and vibrant. From pedestrian-friendly streets to mixed-use developments, their goal is to create communities that foster social interaction, economic growth, and environmental harmony. Well-planned urban spaces are crucial for improving quality of life in rapidly growing cities.

        <p className=" mt-2">Gone are the days when buildings were either functional or beautiful. Today’s architects blend aesthetics with practicality, designing structures that are visually striking while meeting the needs of their users. This balance ensures that spaces are not only admired for their appearance but also valued for their usability and purpose.</p>
