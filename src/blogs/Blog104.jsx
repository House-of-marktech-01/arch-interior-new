        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Red: Energize Your Spaces</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Red is a dynamic and powerful color that energizes and stimulates. It’s an excellent choice for spaces where social interaction and liveliness are encouraged, like living rooms and dining areas. Use red as an accent color with furniture, rugs, or artwork to add warmth and vitality without overwhelming the space.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Blue: Calm and Soothe</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Blue is the go-to color for creating a calm and serene atmosphere. Perfect for bedrooms, it helps promote relaxation and better sleep. In home offices, blue can aid in concentration and mental clarity. Pair lighter shades of blue with neutral tones for a tranquil and balanced environment.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Yellow: Boost Creativity</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Bright and cheerful, yellow is a color of optimism and creativity. It’s ideal for workspaces, playrooms, or kitchens where a burst of energy can inspire productivity and joy. However, use yellow sparingly in softer shades to avoid it feeling too intense or overwhelming.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Green: Balance and Harmony</h2>
        <p className=" mt-2">Green, the color of nature, brings balance and harmony to any room. It works well in living rooms, bathrooms, and even bedrooms, where a touch of greenery can make the space feel refreshing and vibrant. Combine green with natural elements like wood and stone for a cohesive look.
